      <p>Title: The state of Eutrophication at Horsetooth Reservoir</p>
      <p>This topic is important because as climate change makes an impact
  on the amount of precipitation we see here in Colorado, our streams
  and local reservoirs will feel the
  impact(<xref alt="Assessment and Plan 2016" rid="ref-assessment2016upper" ref-type="bibr">Assessment
  and Plan 2016</xref>). The water being held in Horsetooth is used as a
  spot of recreation as well as a source for agriculture and industrial
  use(<xref alt="Gelder et al. 2003" rid="ref-gelder2003eutrophication" ref-type="bibr">Gelder
  et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Hypothesis:</p>
      <p>How has climate change impacted the state of eutrophication at
  Horsetooth over the last 5 years?</p>
      <p>we expect that the state of eutrophication will increase as inputs
  are decreased and temperatures increase.</p>
      <p>Methods:</p>
      <p>Looking at data pulled from USGS from the last 5 years, create an
  analysis of trends in precipitation, stream discharge, dissolved
  oxygen, and temperature to discuss changes in stream inputs and
  outputs. Using the data create a report about the state of
  Eutrophication of Horsetooth Reservoir.</p>
      <p>Outcome:</p>
      <p>Based on the outcome we would expect to see a decrease in inputs
  which would have some effect on the nutrient load within Horsetooth.
  The increase in residence time, coupled with a decrease in inputs,
  would lead to an expected increase in eutrophication.</p>
      <p>Resources:</p>
      <p>Using USGS water quality data as the main
  source(<xref alt="USGS, n.d.a" rid="ref-horsetoothData" ref-type="bibr">USGS,
  n.d.a</xref>).</p>

      <p>Title:</p>
      <p>Change in temperature within the city of Denver as population
  increases The heat island effect which states that as infrastructure
  increases in comparison to green space, the average temperature of the
  areas will increase. This happens because the green space helps
  monitor moisture in an area. When you remove green areas and put in
  more concrete and black top you reduce the moisture content leading to
  a hot, dry city. You can use population data to gauge how developed a
  city is over time. As climate change is perpetuated, cities will
  become hotter which leads to dangerous circumstances for those who
  live within the city.</p>
      <p>Hypothesis:</p>
      <p>With the increase in population, the temperature will increase as
  well.</p>
      <p>Methods:</p>
      <p>Using temperature records from
  USGS(<xref alt="Data, n.d." rid="ref-denvertemp" ref-type="bibr">Data,

  in population within the city of Denver to see the determined effect
  on rising
  temperatures(<xref alt="Bureau, n.d." rid="ref-DenverPop" ref-type="bibr">Bureau,

      <p>Title: How Tree Canopy Affects Urban Heat and Inequality</p>
      <p>Justification: Cities are usually hotter than the areas around them
  because of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This happens when
  buildings, roads, and other hard surfaces soak up and hold heat,
  especially when few trees or green spaces are around. Tree cover helps
  cool things down by providing shade and lowering surface and air
  temperatures. However, not all neighborhoods have the same tree
  canopy. Lower-income and marginalized communities often have fewer
  trees and more heat exposure [Voelkel
  (<xref alt="n.d." rid="ref-UrbanHeat" ref-type="bibr">n.d.</xref>).
  That means these communities are more vulnerable to heat-related
  health issues and less prepared for climate impacts. By looking at how
  tree canopy relates to temperature and demographics, we can better
  understand these patterns and push for equal urban planning and
  climate solutions
  (<xref alt="Zitler, n.d." rid="ref-TreeCanopy" ref-type="bibr">Zitler,
  n.d.</xref>)].</p>
      <p>Research Objective / Hypothesis: We want to find out if areas with
  more tree canopy are cooler, and if low-income or minority
  neighborhoods tend to have less tree cover.</p>
      <p>Hypothesis: More tree canopy means lower surface temperatures, but
  the benefits are not shared equally across different socioeconomic
  groups.</p>
      <p>Proposed Methods: We will use MODIS satellite data to get surface
  temperature and tree canopy data from the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban
  FIA or local city GIS data. For demographic data (like income and
  race), we will use the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
  (ACS). We will pick one city to focus on and look at trends over the
  past 5-10 years. In RStudio, we will run correlation and regression
  analyses to see how tree canopy, temperature, and demographics are
  related. We will also use ggplot2 and tidyverse tools to make maps and
  graphs.</p>
      <p>Expected Outcomes: We expect that more tree cover leads to cooler
  surface temperatures, but disadvantaged neighborhoods often do not get
  as much of that benefit. These results support more equitable
  tree-planting and greening projects in cities.</p>

      <p>Title: How Rising Temperatures Are Impacting Corn and Soybean
  Yields in the Midwest</p>
      <p>Justification: Midwestern agriculture depends heavily on stable
  weather, but with climate change, farmers are already dealing with
  hotter temperatures, less predictable rainfall, and more extreme
  weather. These changes are especially tough on crops like corn and
  soybeans, which are significant parts of the region’s economy
  (<xref alt="Lobell, n.d." rid="ref-Climatetrends" ref-type="bibr">Lobell,
  n.d.</xref>). Heat during the growing season can hurt plant growth and
  lower yields, especially during sensitive periods like pollination
  (<xref alt="Hatfield, n.d." rid="ref-Tempextremes" ref-type="bibr">Hatfield,
  n.d.</xref>). This project aims to figure out how climate trends have
  affected these crops and what that means for the future of farming in
  the Midwest.</p>
      <p>Research Objective / Hypothesis: Our goal is to explore how rising
  temperatures and changes in precipitation have affected corn and
  soybean yields in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana over the past 20+
  years.</p>
      <p>Hypothesis: Hotter summers, especially extreme heat during June
  through August, are linked to lower crop yields, while steady rainfall
  has a more positive effect.</p>
      <p>Proposed Methods: We will get temperature and rainfall data from
  NOAA and crop yield data from the USDA’s National Agricultural
  Statistics Service. The study will cover the years 2000 to 2023. We
  will clean and organize the data in R, then use time series analysis
  and linear regression to see how climate variables and crop yields
  relate. To test our hypothesis, we will also use ggplot2 to make
  visualizations.</p>
      <p>Expected Outcomes: The results will likely show that high
  temperatures, especially heat waves, hurt crop yields, while
  consistent rainfall helps. This kind of analysis can help farmers and
  policymakers prepare for climate change and make more informed
  decisions about agriculture in the region.</p>

      <p>Title: Climate Change Impacts on the United States Population</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Justification: It is important to examine how the United States
  population intersects with the effects of climate change. Using data
  for climate change from Awesome Public Datasets
  (<xref alt="Washington Post, n.d." rid="ref-USClimateChange" ref-type="bibr">Washington
  Post, n.d.</xref>)and US Census Data
  (<xref alt="n.d." rid="ref-USCensusData" ref-type="bibr">n.d.</xref>)
  population data we can examine which areas of the US are most at risk
  for climate change impacts and how many people will be impacted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Research objective/question/hypothesis: Which populations of the
  United States will be most impacted by climate change?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Proposed Methods: To investigate this question I would join these
  two datasets by their “fips” identifiers. I would then use a linear
  model to test the relationship between temperature change and state
  population. I would also take a closer look at which states have had
  the most temperature and precipitation change using tibbles.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Expected Outcomes: I expect to find that heavily populated states
  and cities will have exacerbated temperature increases due to the
  urban heat island effect. Additionally, I do not expect there to be
  more correlations but it will be interesting to see which US
  populations are experiencing the most significant effects so far.</p>

      <p>Title: Salmon in Oregon Rivers</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Justification: Oregon has recently removed major dams
  (<xref alt="USGS, n.d.b" rid="ref-DamRemoval" ref-type="bibr">USGS,
  n.d.b</xref>) and this is impacting salmon conservation efforts. I
  want to explore the intersection of dams and water quality
  (<xref alt="USGS, n.d.c" rid="ref-OregonStreams" ref-type="bibr">USGS,
  n.d.c</xref>)and salmon populations in Oregon
  rivers(<xref alt="Meengs and Lackey 2005" rid="ref-meengs2005estimating" ref-type="bibr">Meengs
  and Lackey 2005</xref>)because salmon are an important species to
  conserve and are impacted by human aquatic infrastructure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Research objective/question/hypothesis: I hypothesize that as water
  quality improves in Oregon river systems that there will be an
  increase in salmon runs in these river systems.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Proposed Methods: To explore this hypothesis I will use a linear
  regression model to analyze the relationship between river water
  quality and salmon runs.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Expected Outcomes: I expect to find that better water quality
  results will stem from rivers without dams or recent dam removals, and
  that this in turn will lead to increased salmon runs. I think salmon
  runs will increase in these conditions because aquatic species tend to
  thrive in better water conditions and will thrive in river systems
  where their migration is not impacted by infrastructure (such as
  dams).</p>
